BC eZ Admin Design Override extension TODO
==========================

There are still quite a lot of features we could
add to BC eZ Admin Design Override.

A few users of BC eZ Admin Design Override may require further
extension of the default solution to include addition features.

If you are interested in sponsoring the development
of any of these features for your eZ Publish web site,
please contact info@brookinsconsulting.com

Features for consideration:

- Fork of this effort for a near no privilage editor, with security locking efforts done on polic/setup/ext-modules/etc (anything but editing and publishing).
- Documentation on what specific features give the end user. In the first version simply installation branding that label that installation as a BC Customer installation.
